# Adventure Game

Text-based RPG written in C++17. Manage your character, collect weapons and armor, use potions, and embark on a procedural adventure from the terminal.

## Features
- **Character System**: Randomized stats based on profession (health, strength, agility, intelligence, defense, gold).
- **Inventory Management**: Add, remove, resize, and manage weapons, armor, and potions.
- **Equipment**: Equip and unequip weapons and armor to modify attack and defense values.
- **Potion Effects**: Apply active buffs/debuffs with different potencies and durations.
- **Dynamic Events**: Randomized encounters, traders, and story-driven plot points.
- **Combat & Stats**: Real-time stat display with active effect processing.
- **Cross-platform**: Compiles on Windows (MinGW/MSVC), Linux, and macOS.

## Project Structure
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Main.cpp` | Entry point (`main()` → calls `MainFunction()`). |
| `MainFunction.cpp` | Main menu, game loop, inventory interaction. |
| `Header.h` | Class declarations for `Character`, `Weapon`, `Armory`, `Potion`, `MyInventory`, `OtInventory`, `Item`, and global functions. |
| `Character.cpp` | Character stats, equip/unequip logic, effect processing. |
| `Weapon.cpp` | Weapon randomization, durability, info display. |
| `Armory.cpp` | Armor randomization, durability, info display. |
| `Potion.cpp` | Potion effects, database, usage. |
| `Inventory.cpp` | Inventory array management, display, add/delete/resize. |
| `Addition.cpp` | Startup (`StartGame`), difficulty choice (`ChoiceHard`), help text. |
| `Plot.cpp` | Story/lore events. |
| `Action.cpp` | Combat/action logic. |
| `OtherCharacter.cpp` | NPC and trader logic. |
| `OtherRandomizer.cpp` | Shared randomization helpers. |
| `Evets.cpp` | Random event triggers. |
| `Trade.cpp` | Trading/shop system. |

## Requirements
- A C++17 compiler:
  - **GCC / MinGW-w64** (recommended)
  - **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)**
  - **Clang**
- **Git** (optional, for cloning)
- Windows, Linux, or macOS

## Building

### GCC / MinGW-w64 (Recommended)
Compile **all** `.cpp` files together:

```bash
g++ -Wall -Wextra -g3 *.cpp -o AdventureGame.exe
Or explicitly:

g++ -Wall -Wextra -g3 Main.cpp MainFunction.cpp Character.cpp Weapon.cpp Armory.cpp Potion.cpp Inventory.cpp Addition.cpp Plot.cpp OtherCharacter.cpp Action.cpp OtherRandomizer.cpp Evets.cpp Trade.cpp -o AdventureGame.exe
Static Build (Portable)
To generate a standalone executable without requiring MinGW DLLs on the target machine:

g++ -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -static *.cpp -o AdventureGame.exe
Microsoft Visual Studio
Open Visual Studio → Open a Local Folder → select the project folder.
Build → Build Solution.
Run with Local Windows Debugger.
Visual Studio Code
Install the C/C++ Extension by Microsoft.
Open the project folder.
In the integrated terminal (`Ctrl + ``), run the GCC command above.
Running
After compilation, run the executable:

Windows: AdventureGame.exe
Linux/macOS: ./AdventureGame
Gameplay
Upon launch, the main menu appears:

=== MAIN MENU ===
1. Start game
2. Show character stats
3. Show your inventory
4. Manage your Inventory
5. Get info
6. Help
0. Exit
Commands
Start Game — chooses difficulty and begins the adventure.
Show Character Stats — displays health, strength, agility, intelligence, defense, gold, equipped weapon/armor, and active effects.
Show Inventory — lists all items with IDs, names, types, and values.
Manage Inventory — submenu for additional inventory operations.
Get Info — detailed weapon/armor inspection, equip/unequip commands.
Help — quick reference for controls.
Exit — closes the application.
Submenu: Get Info
1. Display inventory
2. Show weapon stats
3. Equip weapon
4. Unequip weapon
5. Show armor stats
6. Equip armor
7. Unequip armor
0. Back to main menu
GitHub Actions
This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/c-cpp.yml) that automatically builds the project on every push to main.

To download the latest automated build:

Open the repository on GitHub.
Go to Actions → latest successful workflow.
Download the generated artifact.
Extract and run AdventureGame.
Windows Defender / SmartScreen Warning
Because the executable is not digitally signed, Windows SmartScreen may display a warning when running for the first time:

Windows protected your PC

Click More Info → Run Anyway. This is expected behavior for unsigned educational projects.

Troubleshooting
undefined reference errors during linking
Make sure all .cpp files are passed to the compiler. The project relies on definitions spread across multiple translation units. The wildcard *.cpp is the easiest way to avoid this.

g++: command not found
Install MinGW-w64 or MSYS2 and ensure g++ is in your system PATH. Verify with:

g++ --version
Missing features or crashes
Verify all source files are present in the same directory and none have been renamed or removed. The project requires C++17 support.
